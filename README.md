# proposal

Narrative idea:
  - iterate through all normal volcanoes and highlight especially deadly ones (ie high death, damage, injury, etc)
     - perhaps give certain unique sections (and interactive buttons) to special eruptions like pompeii (vesuvius) or kraketoa
  - Similarly hypothesize certain eruptions to be more deadly pre interaction
  - Compare earthquake based volcanoes to tsunami based volcanos
  - geo map style? (maybe lab 6 look into)
  - iterate by year (implement auto, speed up, pause, skip to certain year, displaying eruptions overtime overlayed with world map)
  - color or other data reprsentation splitting for country, number of deaths, damage etc. (some sort of categorical data representation, probably look into lecture 3 the more categorical stuff we add)
